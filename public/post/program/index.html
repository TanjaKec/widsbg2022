<p>On the <strong>26th of March, 2022</strong> <span style="color:green"><strong>Belgrade</strong></span> is joining the international conference <a href="https://www.widsconference.org">WiDS</a>. The <a href="https://www.widsconference.org">Women in Data Science (WiDS)</a> initiative aims to inspire and educate data scientists worldwide, regardless of gender, and support women in the field. WiDS started as a conference at Stanford in November 2015. Now, <span style="color:green"><strong>WiDS</strong></span> includes a global conference, with 150+ regional events worldwide including a <a href="https://www.widsconference.org/datathon.html">datathon</a> (encouraging participants to hone their skills) and a <a href="https://www.widsconference.org/podcast.html">podcast</a> (featuring leaders in the field talking about their work, and their journeys).</p>
<p>All genders are invited to attend <span style="color:green"><strong>WiDS</strong></span> regional events, which feature outstanding women within the DS community. <span style="color:green"><strong>WiDS Belgrade</strong></span> welcomes anyone with an interest in DS. The goal is to promote DS, exchange knowledge and create a DS community among women. We are fully inclusive and respectful of LGBT identities and are welcome anyone interested in the field of DS.</p>
<p>Our programme contains robotic workshop for mums and kids and discussions by focusing on diversity and mentorship. The event will be hosted by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/isidora-gataric/">Isidora Gatarić</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Valentina Đorđević</strong> <em>is a passionate Data Science enthusiast. Her focus of studying includes time series analysis and anomaly detection techniques. As a Data Scientist at <a href="https://thingsolver.com/">Things Solver</a>, she’s been working on various Data Science problems coming from different business domains, from telecommunications to retail, finance and banking, where she’s dealing with forecasting, predictive maintenance, anomaly detection, segmentation, churn prediction, lead generation, lead scoring, etc. There’s nothing she loves more than sharing her knowledge, and letting it grow through the interaction with others.</em></p>

<p><em><span style="color:gray"> Using an example of fragrance industry data I will describe challenges of working with “small data”. First challenge is gathering the data in unified way. I will tell about the results of client’s questionnaires and how important is a unified methodology of conducting those experiments. Second challenge is data cleaning - decisions made at this stage have a huge impact on a success and extendibility of the project. Last but not least is modelling sparse data, where a classical train/test split is no longer available. I will present pitfalls that we fell into and how we climb up from them.</span></em></p>

</ul>
<p><em><span style="color:gray">The number of farmers who use smart phones is increasing rapidly and furthermore RGB and thermal cameras are becoming more and more available either as smart phone gadgets or as integrated parts of the smart phone. Using them, farmers could have early information about the wheat yield. Currently, counting ears on part of a field and extrapolating the values for the whole field requires ears to be counted manually, which is prone to subjective evaluation, takes a lot of time and requires large human resources. In the case of larger fields, samples must be taken from more than one location, which additionally slows down the process. The aim of the research was to develop a system for wheat ear recognition and counting, which is necessary step for further estimation of wheat ear coverage density in the field, and yield prediction. Images of winter wheat were taken at 4 dates during the growing season and segmented manually to acquire the ground truth. Image segmentation was done using deep learning. Namely, convolutional neural networks were applied to RGB and thermal images and the results were compared to the ground truth to assess the system accuracy. Development of a comprehensive system for ear counting and yield prediction has a huge practical value for crop monitoring and optimal decision-making in wheat production.</span></em></p>

She is highly interested in the application of machine learning algorithms and deep learning in the field of agriculture. She has expanded the field experiment on the wheat involving images from mobile phones to provide early prediction yield and automatic counted ears.
